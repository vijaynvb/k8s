1. create a deployment which will generate random data in the container 
for just 1 minute and make the container restart purposefully with livenessprobe check.

2. have another deployment which will read the data from the volume and expose 
it as a web page using nginx

3. for sharing between pods we can use any type of volume

4. expose service to access the web page from deployment 2 via node ip address
